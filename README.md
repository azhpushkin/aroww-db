### Aroww DB

Inspired by "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" book and
"What I cannot create I do not understand" quote by R. Feynman.

At a time of writing, simple key-value database, 
created for learning purposes only.



**Future plans on things to add**:
- [ ] Static code analyzers [clang-tidy, cppcheck, clazy]
- [x] Sourse code formatter [clang-format]
- [ ] Documentation and docs generation [doxygen]
- [ ] Package managers? [Conan, vcpkg]
- [ ] See if `fmt` lib is useful and add if needed
- [ ] Logging of event to gather metric [`spdlog` or what?] *IMPORTANT QUITE SOON*
- [ ] Implementing some basic tests
- [ ] Some way of writing unit tests
